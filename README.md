This program allows for managing a file of images

This repository contains all of the files for a Visual Studio Express solution

The executable is available by plowing down to the bin/Release folder

It will create a "Data" subfolder with the same name as the executable in the containing folder.
You can place a shortcut there to the images you want or click on the appropriate buttons.
It will attach a keyword with the name of the folder to all files within that folder.
It will plow down through any links but will use the keyword for that link
It will attach a keyword for the year of the image file

If you modify the "Data" subfolder manually, please restart the program.
